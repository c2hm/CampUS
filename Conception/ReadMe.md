# Prototype #1
The first prototype has an elongated X body shape with the legs pointing in the elongated direction. This was making the robot really long especially because the pivot point of the leg were towards the outside of the body. The shoulder are positioned over the frame making the robot really low profile.

# Prototype #2
In the second prototype, the shoulder are the part who change the most. The pivot point as been moved toward the center of the frame so that the servo as been flipped. To acheived that the shoulder need to be moved under the frame. This make sure that the motor mount doesn't be to high to not interfere with the body. The frame has been reduced in size to just be large enough for the OpenCR card.
