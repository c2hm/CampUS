Code and movement ideas:
- guided movement or predetermined path (Probably code both)
- action blocks to use sequentially
- start with straight lines, elevated straight lines (45,90,135), then try to turn
- UI with action selections, path selection, init., entry parameters (position vs. distance, angle)
- Try movement with 2 contact points, keep 3 as a backup option
