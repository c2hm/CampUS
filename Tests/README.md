To ensure the proper working of each of the project elements, four test plans were made: electrical, interface, communication and integration. The electrical test plan tests the assembly of the Protoboard by analyzing the response of the electromagnets and servomotors. The interface test plan mainly ensures that it does not crash when several buttons are pressed at the same time. In addition, the user cannot send orders with letters or special characters. The communication test plan checks that all commands sent by the interface are received by the master code and sends back an acknowledgment of receipt to the interface. Finally, the integration test plan is a mix between that of the interface and the communication but we replace the last by the robot. It is therefore verifying whether the robot reacts well to the commands of the interfaces.
