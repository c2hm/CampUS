About the Arduino plugins:

Each pins has a maximum output current of 5mA. Total output current from pins should not reach over Â±120mA

Arduino's already used pins by openCR:
 - 13



About the OpenCR plugins:

The total power consumption on 12V and 5V ports should not exceed 55W.



About the circuit: 

The unamed sources are plugins used on OpenCR.

The 12V port is used with the mosfet to give power for the electromagnets.

Two TTL ports is used for the motors. (multiple or just one can be used)
